# To handle raw strings in Python, you can use the 'r' prefix before the string.
raw_string = r"This is a raw string.\n It will not interpret escape sequences like \n or \t."
print(raw_string)
# Wihout the 'r' prefix, the string would interpret \n as a newline character.

# Example of a raw string with a file path
file_path = r"C:\Users\Username\Documents\file.txt"
print(file_path)
